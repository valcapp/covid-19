# covid-19 SD Simulator
This is a simple app to demonstrate the integration of a System Dynamics model into a Web page using pysd and Flask Python libraries. 
It runs the publicly available Community Coronavirus Conceptual Model (Tom Fiddaman, Ventana Systems, Inc., 2020) to simulate the diffusion of COVID-19.
