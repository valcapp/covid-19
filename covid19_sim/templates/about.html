        <p class="lead">This application was realized by Valerio Cappuccio as an experiment and demonstration of the integrating of a system dynamics model into a web page. It is not an official page and is still work in progress. The model is abstract and not initialized with real data, so any output is dummy data.</p>
        <p>
            The system dynamics model used is the publicly available <a href="http://vensim.com/coronavirus/">Community Coronavirus Conceptual Model</a> Tom Fiddaman, Ventana Systems, Inc., 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application uses a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> server to render .html templates and run in the background the Python version of the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system dynamics model was converted into Python using <a href="https://pysd.readthedocs.io/en/master/">PySD</a> library developed by James P. Houghton.
